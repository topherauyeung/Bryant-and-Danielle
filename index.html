					This tale of love and romance begins in sunny San Diego, in the year two-thousand and eight.

						He was a nerdy, high-school-musical Chinese boy who loved to dance and make a fool of himself. She was a cool, pocket-sized Filipino girl who loved to drink boba and also liked to make a fool of herself. Ironically, their friendship began when she asked him for advice about boys. Bryant fell for Danielle first - it took her a little while to see her Prince Charming behind those black-rimmed glasses and ridiculous facial expressions. But eventually, his good looks and stunning smile melted her heart. They began dating in the summer of 2009. When school started back up again in the fall, they began to lead a Bible study together for InterVarsity at UC San Diego and quickly realized just how good they were for each other. Things were looking pretty swell.

						Then, Bryant - that troublemaker - had to go and graduate and move back to Fremont, marking the start of their three years of long distance. Some say that distance makes the heart grow fonder, but they quickly discovered that sometimes, too much distance makes the heart grow weary. By God’s grace (and the wonders of FaceTime, Facebook, and $79 Southwest tickets) they continued to grow in love and admiration for each other.
					</p>
					<p class="pull-quote tk-adelle fc-purplegray--dk">
						But, as if the 500 miles between Fremont and San Diego wasn’t enough distance, Danielle decided to go to the Philippines to serve at Rizal Provincial Jail for six months.
					</p>
					<p class="tk-adelle fc-purplegray--dk">
						It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. With Danielle gone, Bryant had more time to focus on his journey to becoming a Murse (short for Man-Nurse) at Samuel Merritt University. After many sacrifices and some extremely hard work, he finally achieved his license as a Registered Nurse. And he finally bought a ring. The day Danielle returned from the Philippines, Bryant decided that he had a very important question to ask her (and that it <em>really</em> couldn’t wait until she was out of her sweat pants).
